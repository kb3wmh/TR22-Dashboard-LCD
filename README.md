## Hardware Information
This project is designed to control a [4DSystems Gen4-uLCD-50DT-SB LCD Display](https://4dsystems.com.au/gen4-ulcd-50dt-sb).

Control software is written in C for a BeagleBone Black.

## Prerequisites
To open/modify the display layout you will need 4DSystems' [Workshop4](https://4dsystems.com.au/workshop4) software.

**This software is still an early work-in-progress, and I give no guarantees of support. Use at your own risk!**
